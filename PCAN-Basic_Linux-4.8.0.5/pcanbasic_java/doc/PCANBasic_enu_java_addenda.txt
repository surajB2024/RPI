Differences with documentation
==============================

Some features listed in the PCAN Basic documentation are changed due to incompatibilities with Java language.

- The following parameters have a slightly different behaviour/usage than the one described in the documentation:
	* PCAN_ATTACHED_CHANNELS: in GetValue function, 4th parameter BufferLength represents the size of the buffer passed as 3rd parameter. 
		For this PCAN-Basic parameter, if the JNI library detects that the buffer (passed as 3rd parameter) is a TPCANChannelInformation array, then 4th parameter is ignored and the size is calculated from the length of the array.
	* PCAN_API_VERSION: if the versions between PVANBasic and PCANBasic_JNI do not match, the JNI API version is concatenated to the buffer (for ex.: "4.8.0.830 (JNI=4.8.1.2)")
